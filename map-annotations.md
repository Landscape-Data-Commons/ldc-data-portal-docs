## Finding
Map annotations are found near the bottom of the map and directly below the map.

## Scale Line
The scale line, located in the lower right-hand corner of the map, provides 
a metric distance scale that changes according to zoom level.

## Selected Plots
The Selected Plots subsection (below the map on the left) shows the number of 
plots that have been selected using the polygon map control or the selectors
and indicators in the Filters panel.

## Latitude/Longitude
The Latitude/Longitude subsection below the map on the right-hand side shows the
latitude and longitude values that correspond to the current position of the mouse pointer
when hovering over the map.
