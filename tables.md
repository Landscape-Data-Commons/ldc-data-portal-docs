## Finding
The map tables appear below the map when plots are selected. The Filters and Indicators tables are always shown, but the other 6 tables are only populated with data if the user has logged in (and so has agreed to
the LDC data disclaimer). It's also important to note that while all selected sites are shown on the map, the corresponding data rows in the tables are limited to (a) 10 rows each for the Filters and Indicators 
tables and (b) 200 rows for each of the other 6 tables. Pressing the Next button that appears at the bottom of each table will advance to the next set of data rows for a given table. Use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the tables and the vertical scroll bar on the right-hand side of the tables to view rows and columns.

## Filters
This table shows the data, 10 rows at a time, corresponding to the selectors and indicators chosen in the Filters panel.

## Indicators

This table shows additional indicator data, 10 rows at a time, corresponding to the selectors and indicators chosen in the Filters panel.

## Species Indicators

The Species Indicators table shows all species-indicators data, 200 rows at a time, that correspond to the plot Primary Key values in the Filters table.

## Line-Point Intercept

The Line-Point Intercept table shows the raw line-point intercept data, 200 rows at a time, that correspond to the plot Primary Key values in the Filters table.

## Canopy Gap

The Canopy Gap table shows the raw canopy gap data, 200 rows at a time, that correspond to the
plot Primary Key values in the Filters table.

## Vegetation Height

The Vegetation Height table shows the raw vegetation height data, 200 rows at a time, that correspond to the plot Primary Key values in the Filters table.

## Species Inventory

The Species Inventory table shows the raw species inventory data, 200 rows at a time, that correspond to the plot Primary Key values in the Filters table.

## Soil Stability

The Soil Stability table shows the raw soil stability data, 200 rows at a time, that correspond to the
plot Primary Key values in the Filters table.
